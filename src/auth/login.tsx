            <strong>Welcome!</strong> This app is a minimal yet meaningful
            social platform for you and your friends to share amazing moments
            with each other â€” one month at a time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How Monthly Moments works</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            It&apos;s like a monthly newsletter; everyone writes about Moments
            from their lives throughout each month, and then at the beginning of
            the next month, all of those Moments are shared out to their
            friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Examples of Moments</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Generally, Moments capture the the parts of your life that you want
            to share with your friends, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Major life events and milestones</li>
            <li>Events you went to or were a part of</li>
            <li>Happenings, life updates, changes</li>
            <li>Projects, accomplishments, achievements</li>
            <li>
              Activities and things you enjoyed, spent time with, or found
              meaningful
            </li>
            <li>Media, entertainment, games, movies, books</li>
          </ul>
